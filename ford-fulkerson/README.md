This is an implementation of the Ford Fulkerson algorithm to solve the Maximum Flow problem.

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

For example,
Given [1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18],
return [1,6],[8,10],[15,18]


Problem:

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

For example:
Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.


Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

Thoughts

Straightforward! Recursively do the job.


Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.


Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

This is a classic interview question. Another similar problem is "merge k sorted lists".
